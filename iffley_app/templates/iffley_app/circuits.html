    <p>According to Steve Broadbent, circuits were initially a selection of problems that people were using to warm up before working on harder projects.</p> 
    <p>The goal is to try and climb all problems of a circuit in a single session and some people even go as far as to try and complete them as fast as possible, known as speed circuiting!</p>

                    <p>A collection of the walls easiest problems, designed to challenge people who have never climbed before. They require a range of different fundamental techniques to complete, and can be done with  very little strength. 
                        All are short person friendly, and have been climbed in trainers. Those who complete it or find it too easy should move up to <b>The Welcome Circuit</b> then <b>The Purple Circuit</b>.</p>
                    <p>Most of the problems have holds in brackets at the start; these are the starting holds and you can start however you like so long as you only use these holds. If there are no bracketed holds at the start then it is a sit 
                        start; you must start from sitting on the ground and pull onto the wall using any holds in the problem.</p>
                    <p>The last hold is a bonus hold, and the problem is graded excluding this. It is there to provide an extra challenge for those who found the problem too easy.</p>

                    <p>Picked out in 2006 as "The five best easy problems for Iffley novices" this mini-circuit is a good place to start if you've never climbed at Iffley before. 
                        All of the prbolems are suitable for shorter climbers. More experienced climbers may like to run throguh this circuit as a warm-up, reversing each problem as they go.</p>

                    <p>Iffley's easiest full circuit, the purple problems all feature standing starts, so are an ideal place for Iffley-newcomers to get a feel for the wall before progressing to some of the tricky sit-start problems. 
                        Nothing too taxing here, even for shorter climbers...</p>

                    <p>A popular entry-level circuit with a good selection of low-grade problems that demonstrate good Iffley technique and don't require any long stretches. A good first circuit for those with a little bit of Iffley experience.</p>

                    <p>The original easy circuit is unfortunately misnamed, as it features a couple of problems that shorter climbers will be unable to complete. Apart from that, this is a nice selection of lines, including some of the walls easier classics. If you're short, then missing out Cat's Cradle still counts...!</p>

                    <p>One of the more recent additions, the Pink Circuit is an exceptionally sustained set of problems that should be an ideal target for shorter climbers looking for a big-time Iffley bouldering objective. None of these problems
                        feature any long stretches, but all are technical and putting the whole circuit together will be an absorbing and rewarding challenge.</p>

                    <p>Iffley's original power circuit! If you're feeling strong then this is the circuit for you, taking in some of the wall's best and most powerful problems. The middle section from the Matrix to Moby Dick is incredibly tiring, and technically challenging.</p>

                    <p>A set of problems - of all grades - hat celebrates the joy of Hold Six. The circuit is designed for the aficionado and the novitiate, the Iffley set darling and the newcomer, the punter and the player. Six is sometimes accomodating, at other times beguiling.
                        Six can be your friend or your enemy. All are set by Tom Povey...

                    <p>The awesome White Circuit is one of the truly difficult objectives on the wall, requiring just about every skill there is going, and many, many months of work. At the time of its conception, these problems practically defined hard Iffley bouldering, and even today they still sit at the top of the ladder. Very few successes have ever been recorded, and the 'speed' record is still held by Steve Broadbent from 2001 at 2 hours and 30 minutes.
